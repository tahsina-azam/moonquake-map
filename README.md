# Description of our project "Selena":

We have our website here “Selena” where we have created a 3d moon globe. Where we can zoom in and zoom out the globe by clicking on the buttons given below as well as using our mouse pointers. We can stop the rotation of the globe using a button. We can also rotate it with our mouse. Here we can see that we have the positions of landing sites of Apollo lunar modules plotted on our globe. When we click the points we would get their latitudes and longitudes on the popover.

From the sidebar, we can choose the different types of moonquakes. By clicking deep moonquake it will pinpoint all the locations where a deep moonquake occurred. Similarly goes for shallow moonquakes, meteorite hits, and artificial impacts. We can know the latitudes and longitudes of the quake positions just by hovering over the points. There is also an option “Learn Moonquake” where we can find every information related to moonquakes.

We are also trying to use the Obspy package to generate time series from the seismic data we got from the JAXA API.

# The data we used:

PDS: Bundle Information (nasa.gov):
From the Apollo Passive Seismic Experiment Expanded Event Catalog, we got the seismic data received by Apollo 11-17. We used those data to get the latitude, longitude, and all relevant data of different seismic events such as deep moonquakes, shallow moonquakes, meteorites, artificial impacts, etc. We used those data and visualize them in a 3D globe on our website.

https://www.darts.isas.jaxa.jp/pub/apollo/: By using this JAXA site we get the magnetic tapes to send by the apollo lunar modules back to earth. We used python modules such as Obspy to transform the binary files to time-series to visualize the seismic events more clearly.
